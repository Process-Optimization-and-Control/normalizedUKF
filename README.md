# The Simple Solution for Nonlinear State Estimation of Ill-Conditioned Systems: The Normalized Unscented Kalman Filter

Code for the paper "The Simple Solution for Nonlinear State Estimation of Ill-Conditioned Systems: The Normalized Unscented Kalman Filter", submitted to IFAC World Congress2023.

The folder "script" contains the Python files. Run "chol_3x3.py" for the Normalized Cholesky decomposition (section 4.1 in the article). Run "main_fb.py" for the case study of the Normalized Unscented Kalman Filter (NUKF, section 4.2 in the article).
